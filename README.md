# YEET Compiler
This is a simple complex calculator using yacc and lex. Gramatical implementation uses BNF form. Saves instruction in a special stack. The lexer implemented from scratch runs in c.  YEET is a basic programming language that features variables, arrays, control statements, double-precision floats, functions, file reading, recursion, and array. YEET is based on C and is a compiled structured language. Functions can call themselves, allowing recursion.
